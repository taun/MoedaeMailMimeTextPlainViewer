<bold>Now</bold> is the time for <italic>all</italic>
good men
<smaller>(and <<women>)</smaller> to
<ignoreme>come</ignoreme>

to the aid of their


<color><param>red</param>beloved</color>
country.

By the way,
I think that <paraindent><param>left</param><<smaller>

</paraindent>should REALLY be called

<paraindent><param>left</param><<tinier></paraindent>

and that I am always right.
